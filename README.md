## Description

As a full-stack web developer, it's important to know the inner workings of back-end coding, particularly regarding internet retail. Internet retail, also known as [e-commerce](https://www.businessnewsdaily.com/15858-what-is-e-commerce.html), is "the process of selling goods and services over the internet." My first job was working retail and I worked as a sales associate for 3 years. Over the course of my employment, I saw personally how each year, more and more consumers were choosing to buy online rather than in-person shopping. Since the pandemic, shopping online has become even more prevalent. As a result, it's important to understand the fundamental framework of platforms that businesses use daily. Please read along to see how I've used object-relational mapping (ORM) to build the back end for an e-commerce site! &#129321;
